# ML 101

AI is a discipline, has to do with theory and methods. Theory and methods build machines.
ML is a toolset, like Newton's Laws of Physics.
Machines are trained and learn.


Train an ML model with examples
Supervised Learning: (label, input)
Models are mathematical functions
Output is closer to label for any input.

Predict with a trained model. unlabeled input. 
Models generalized about new data.
Data is the fuel for ML models.

2 Stages: 
 1. Training 
 2. Inference

Pitfall: Over emphasize model training
Putting ML models in production
Training deep NN's takes computing power & availability of data(Reason for 1 hidden layer in neural network)

1. Identify the sign
2. OCR the characters
3. Identify language
4. Translate language
5. Superimpose text
6. Select correct font

Repeated predictive insights from data

ML replaces hardcoded heuristic rules

Anything for which you are writing rules for today. Scale, automate & personalize

# Day 2

1. What is being predicted?
2. What data is needed?
3. Who will use this service? (API)


Manufacturing: Demand Forecasting
Travel & Hospitality: Dynamic Pricing

Pretrained models
A* Algorithm

1. Having data
2. Collecting the data, weighting the data(finding labels)
3. Manual analysis helps you fail fast.
4. Know your data
5. Journey towards automation at scale

Training Serving Skew
Model should be same in serving & training

Training should scale to handle a lot of data.
Prediction should scale to handle large number of queries per second.

Magic of ML comes from quantity, not complexity.

Infuse your apps with ML
Use ML to fine tune business process
Delight your users
